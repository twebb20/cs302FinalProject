    Summary: Over the course of the week, I became very acquainted with the Unity UI and how the game engine itself works. I began work along with my teammates developing player movement, spawn control, level design, a main menu, and basic scoring scripts. We met on 3/28 to discuss what we wanted to do for the future of the game and continue to update our TODO google doc to progress through the build.
