Summary:
Over this period (beginning to now) I have set up the logistical documents (todo sheet, time tracking sheet, shared folder) etc. I acquired a trial of the premium version of Unity Teams so we can collaborate easily. In Unity, I have set up the main menu (it's not finished yet) and added menu button functionality. I have additionally added a character (controls need tweaking). I added controls to the character. I also added basic physics to the camera. I added a following camera with offset and added basic placeholder graphics. Rubric one is complete: Unity with collaboration, player and first level have been set up, player controls added, camera set to follow, and basic menu functionality is good now.
